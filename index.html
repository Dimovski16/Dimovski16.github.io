        <h2>Current Program</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently in my third year in the Business Technology Management program at Toronto Metropolitan University.
            This program teaches you how to analyze the needs of businesses, come up with technological based solutions to
            problems and communicate effectively.

        <h3>Favourite Course</h3>
            One of my favourite courses in this program has been <strong>ITM 415</strong>.
            This course was a business process management class that taught us how to use technology to improve business processes.
            I really enjoyed taking this class as it challenged me to be creative and find new ways to make processes more efficient.
