        <h3>Favourite Course</h3>
        <p>
            One of my favourite courses in this program has been ITM 415.
            This course was a business process management class that taught us how to use technology to improve business processes.
            I really enjoyed taking this class as it challenged me to be creative and find new ways to make processes more efficient.
